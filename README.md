# rast-jit-vm-simple

Simpler version of [rast-jit-vm](https://github.com/Patryk27/rast-jit-vm),
without any extra features or refactoring - as live-coded during my recent talk
(to which I'll put the link here as soon as it's available).

When `cargo run`-ed, the program will print 10th Fibonacci number (which you
can adjust around 145th line in `src/main.rs`).
