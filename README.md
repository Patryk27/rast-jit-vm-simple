# rast-jit-vm-simple

Simpler version of [rast-jit-vm](https://github.com/Patryk27/rast-jit-vm),
without any extra features or refactoring - as live-coded during
[my recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryrOZS-CLyo).

When `cargo run`-ed, the program will print 10th Fibonacci number (which you
can adjust around 145th line in `src/main.rs`).
